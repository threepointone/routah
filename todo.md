- change to path-to-regexp for matching
- overwrite context.routah for a subtree (and handle redirects on said tree)
- animations between urls

✓ - server side rendering
✓ - dynamic routing - require.ensure should just work
✓ - redux-simple-router - it just works!
✓ - activeClass / activeStyle - to test
✓ - transitions / leave / enter, onBeforeUnload - these will _not_ fire on server side
~ - scroll states - rackt/scroll-behavior, after historv2 compat
~ - redirects - todo - server side handling
x - async data - not a concern of this library (or fetch prop? or falcor?)
x - index routes? - not needed really
