- animations between urls
- onBeforeUnload / routerWillLeave

- change to path-to-regexp for matching
- overwrite context.routah for a subtree
- handle multiple redirects on the same render tree

- testsssss

✓ - server side rendering
✓ - dynamic routing - require.ensure should just work
✓ - redux-simple-router - it just works!
~ - activeClass / activeStyle - to test
~ - scroll states - rackt/scroll-behavior, after historv2 compat
~ - redirects - todo - server side handling
~ - transitions / leave / enter - rough cut
x - async data - not a concern of this library (or fetch prop? or falcor?)
x - index routes? - not needed really
